<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Sample Rate Converters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Asynchronous Type</li><li>Synchronous Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Sample rate converters are electronic devices used to convert the sampling rate of digital audio signals. These converters can be categorized into two main types: Asynchronous Type and Synchronous Type. Asynchronous Type converters operate independently of the input signal, allowing for more flexibility in handling different sampling rates. On the other hand, Synchronous Type converters synchronize with the input signal, providing a more stable and accurate conversion process. Both types cater to different market needs, with Asynchronous Type converters being more versatile and Synchronous Type converters offering precision and consistency.</p></p>
