<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Spring Failsafe Brake Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dualspring Brake</li><li>Monospring Brake</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Spring Failsafe Brakes can be categorized into two main types: Dualspring Brake and Monospring Brake markets. The Dualspring Brake system utilizes two springs to engage the brake when power is cut off, providing a redundant safety measure. On the other hand, Monospring Brake has a single spring mechanism that serves the same purpose. Both types of brakes are commonly used in industrial applications where safety is a top priority and are designed to prevent accidents in case of power failure.</p></p>
