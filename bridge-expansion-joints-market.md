<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bridge Expansion Joints Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open Joints</li><li>Closed Joints</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Bridge expansion joints are categorized into two main types: open joints and closed joints. Open joints consist of a gap between the bridge decks that allows for expansion and contraction due to temperature changes. Closed joints, on the other hand, are sealed systems that prevent water and debris from entering the gap. Both types play a crucial role in ensuring the longevity and structural integrity of bridges by accommodating movement and protecting against damage caused by environmental factors.</p></p>
