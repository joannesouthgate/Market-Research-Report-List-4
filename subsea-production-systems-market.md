<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Subsea Production Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Stationary Type</li><li>Floating Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Subsea production systems are divided into two main types: stationary type and floating type. Stationary type systems are fixed to the seabed and are used for extracting oil and gas from offshore fields. Floating type systems, on the other hand, are not fixed to the seabed and instead float on the water's surface. They are commonly used in deepwater applications where stationary systems are not practical. Both types of systems play a crucial role in the extraction and production of oil and gas from underwater fields.</p></p>
