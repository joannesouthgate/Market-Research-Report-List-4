<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Harmonic Filter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active Harmonic Filter</li><li>Passive Harmonic Filter</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Harmonic filters are used to mitigate the negative effects of harmonics in electrical systems. There are two main types of harmonic filters: active and passive. Active harmonic filters use power electronics to actively eliminate harmonics generated by non-linear loads, offering dynamic and precise control. Passive harmonic filters, on the other hand, use passive components such as capacitors, reactors, and resistors to absorb or block harmonics. Each type has its own advantages and applications, catering to different needs in terms of cost, performance, and efficiency.</p></p>
