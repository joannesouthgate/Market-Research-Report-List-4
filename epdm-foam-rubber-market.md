<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The EPDM Foam Rubber Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Closed Cell Rubber</li><li>Semi-closed Cell Rubber</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Closed cell rubber is a type of EPDM foam rubber that has sealed cells, preventing the penetration of air or other fluids. This makes it highly water-resistant and ideal for applications where moisture protection is critical, such as in gaskets and seals. Semi-closed cell rubber, on the other hand, has some interconnected cells allowing for limited air and fluid penetration. This type of EPDM foam rubber strikes a balance between flexibility and water resistance, making it suitable for a wider range of applications.</p></p>
