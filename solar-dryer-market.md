<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Solar Dryer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct Type</li><li>Indirect Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Solar dryers can be categorized into two main types: direct type and indirect type. Direct type solar dryers utilize sunlight directly to heat up the drying chamber where the food or products are placed. On the other hand, indirect type solar dryers use a heat exchanger to transfer heat from a solar collector to the drying chamber, thus preventing direct contact between the product and the sunlight. Both types of solar dryers are effective in reducing moisture content in food and products while utilizing the energy of the sun.</p></p>
