<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Multifocal Intraocular Lens Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Refractive Type</li><li>Diffraction Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Multifocal intraocular lenses come in two main types: refractive and diffractive. Refractive multifocal lenses work by bending light to focus images on the retina, providing clear vision at multiple distances. On the other hand, diffractive multifocal lenses use a series of rings on the lens surface to separate light into different focal points, allowing for clear vision at various distances. Both types of lenses offer improved vision for individuals with presbyopia or cataracts, providing a versatile solution for age-related vision issues.</p></p>
