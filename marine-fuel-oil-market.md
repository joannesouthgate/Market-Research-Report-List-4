<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Marine Fuel Oil Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Distillate Fuel Oil</li><li>Residual Fuel Oil</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The marine fuel oil market primarily consists of two types: distillate fuel oil and residual fuel oil. Distillate fuel oil, including Marine Gas Oil (MGO), is lighter and cleaner, often used in more modern ships and meeting stringent environmental regulations. Residual fuel oil, or bunker fuel, is heavier and more viscous, suited for older vessels and large cargo ships, but it typically has higher sulfur content. Both types are crucial for maritime operations, influencing shipping costs and environmental compliance.</p></p>
