<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Sea Water Pumps Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Centrifugal Pumps</li><li>Positive Displacement Pumps</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Sea water pumps market can be categorized into two main types: centrifugal pumps and positive displacement pumps. Centrifugal pumps use a rotating impeller to create a suction force and move water through the pump. They are typically used for large volume applications with relatively low pressure requirements. Positive displacement pumps, on the other hand, use a mechanism to trap and move a fixed amount of water with each cycle. They are better suited for high pressure applications or when precise dosing is required.</p></p>
