<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Aircraft Magneto Ignition System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>High-Tension Ignition Systems</li><li>Low-Tension Ignition Systems</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Aircraft magneto ignition systems can be classified into two main types: high-tension ignition systems and low-tension ignition systems. High-tension ignition systems use a transformer coil to increase voltage before it reaches the spark plug, providing a powerful spark for ignition. On the other hand, low-tension ignition systems rely on a lower voltage level and do not use a transformer coil. Both systems play a crucial role in ensuring reliable ignition in aircraft engines, but they differ in terms of voltage levels and spark generation methods.</p></p>
