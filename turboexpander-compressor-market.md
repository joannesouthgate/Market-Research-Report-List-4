<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Turboexpander Compressor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Radial Turboexpander</li><li>Axial Turboexpander</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Turboexpander compressors are commonly classified into two main types: radial and axial. Radial turboexpanders have a design where the gas flows radially outwards from the center of the machine. They are often used in smaller scale applications. On the other hand, axial turboexpanders have a design where the gas flows in the same direction as the rotating shaft. They are typically used in larger scale applications due to their higher efficiency and ability to handle higher gas flow rates.</p></p>
